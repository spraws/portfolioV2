#notes
I am a cybersecurity student at the <a href="https://www.worcester.ac.uk/">University of Worcester</a>. Through my studies, I have gained experience in web and mobile development, as well as forensic analysis and penetration testing. 

Forensics is my main field of interest, but I am also interested in neural networks, machine learning and offensive security.

Currently I am learning <a href="https://go.dev/"><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faGolang} className="goLang" /></a>  and Python <a href="https://www.python.org/"><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPython} className="python" /></a>

    On the project page, you can find some of the projects I have worked on.
